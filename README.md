# 1 - Ability to spawn Sheriff wagons
Sheriffs can now spawn special wagons designated for law enforcement use.

# 2 - Warehouses added to Sheriff stations
Sheriff stations now include warehouses, which can be used for storage or other operational purposes.

# 3 - Blips added to Sheriff stations
Sheriff stations now appear on the map with blips, making them easier to locate.

# 4 - Sisika Prison sweeping job improvements
The sweeping job in Sisika Prison now changes location each time it’s completed. This helps make the task more dynamic and also contributes to reducing the prisoner’s sentence time.

# 5 - Automatic return for prison escapees
If a prisoner escapes from prison, they are automatically returned to custody, and additional time is added to their sentence. This feature can be enabled or disabled in the configuration file.

# 6 - Hire and fire menu with rank-based permissions
A new menu has been added that allows authorized users to hire or fire employees. Permissions can be configured so that only certain ranks are able to perform these actions.

# 7 - Redesigned player registration menu for detainees
The menu used to register players who are being detained has been completely redesigned for better usability and clarity.

# 8 - Configurable Sheriff menu hotkey
A new key can be assigned to open the Sheriff menu. This key is fully configurable in the configmain.lua file.

# 9 - Sheriff badges
Now be configured in the configmain.lua file, allowing you to add your custom models, as well as define which job and rank have access to each badge.
